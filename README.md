# SeaWars

This is my game I worked on a while ago. It's a chess-board-like battleships game, except your units have abilities and can pick up items.

> :warning: This game is not finished and has bugs! The game crashes in Firefox when the game starts and is about to load the battlefield (Chrome works fine though).

> :warning: I had to remove all model assets, since they have been bought and I am not allowed to provide them to the public in a code repository.

Feel free to fork it and use it for your own project.
